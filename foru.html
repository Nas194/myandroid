<p><em><font color="white">Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you have never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future
                                               When something wonderful happens, you can not wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself.
                                               You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind.
                                               You open your heart knowing that there is a chance it may be broken, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible.
                                               You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. 
                                               I found that person and that's JUST YOU MOTTE. You and only you. This app is JUST FOR YOU. This will always remind you how much I LOVE YOU, how much I feel for you. 
                                               It's simple but just for you my love.

                                               I think about you constantly, whether it's with my mind or my heart. When I miss you, I don't have to go far, I just have to close my eyes because that's when I could see you.
                                               We may be physically apart, but we are connected by a love so strong that it fills me up until I can touch you and hold you again. Know that I miss you and you are with me now forever and ever.
                                               You're never alone untill I take my last breathe. I'll be there for you</font></em></p>
